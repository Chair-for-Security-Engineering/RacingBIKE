RacingBIKE: Improved Polynomial Multiplication and Inversion in Hardware
===

This reposetiy contains the Verilog source code for the paper *RacingBIKE: Improved Polynomial Multiplication and Inversion in Hardware*.

Features
---
RacingBIKE provides a new fast polynomial multiplier, a novel design for the polynomial inversion, and a united hardware design for the PQC scheme [Bit-Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE)](https://bikesuite.org/). The Verilog sources can be found in `src/` including a testbench (`src/TB_BIKE.sv`) and a package (`src/BIKE_package.sv`) to configure the implementation. 

The testbench expects testvectors to perform a behavioral simulation. We provide one set of testvectors for each security level which can be found in `testvectors`. The datasets were generated by the software reference implementation (see [https://bikesuite.org/](https://bikesuite.org/)). 

The configuration file defines all BIKE related parameters and implementation specific parameters. The following tables briefly describe the available parameters. 


**BIKE related parameters:**
BIKE parameter | Verilog parameter | Description
---------------|-------------------|--------------
$r$            | `R_BITS`          | Bit size of the used polynomials
$t$            | `T1`              | Decoding radius
$w$            | `W`               | *w/2* defines the weight of the private key polynomials
$l$            | `L`               | Shared secret size
$\tau$         | `TAU`             | Offset to determine the black and gray lists
$NBIter$       | `NBITER`          | Number of iterations of the decoder
threshold $a$* | `TH_F`            | Multiplication factor for the threshold computation
threshold $b$* | `TH_T`            | Constant term added in the threshold computation
threshold $c$* | `MAX_C`           | Minimum value taken by the threshold function

*We describe the threshold function by $\texttt{threshold}(S)=\text{max}(\lfloor a \cdot S + b \rfloor, c)$


**Implementation specific parameters:**
Verilog parameter | Description
------------------|--------------
`B_WIDTH`         | Bandwidth scaling parameter $b$ (tested for $b \in \{32, 64, 128\}$)
`INVERSION_STEPS` | Defines the step size $s$ of the inversion module
`BRAM_CAP`        | Defines the size (in bits) of the memory modules available on the target device
